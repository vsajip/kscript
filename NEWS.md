# Changes

## 4.1.0 - TO BE RELEASED

Breaking changes

* Renamed env variables (cleanup): 
  CUSTOM_KSCRIPT_PREAMBLE -> KSCRIPT_PREAMBLE
  KSCRIPT_IDEA_COMMAND -> KSCRIPT_COMMAND_IDEA
  KSCRIPT_GRADLE_COMMAND -> KSCRIPT_COMMAND_GRADLE

Major Enhancements

* Initial Windows support

Bugfixes
* Fix for dependency resolution
* Fix creation of Gradle files and their indentation
* Fix for handling potentially duplicated file names in Idea projects
* Fix for Idea runtime configuration

## 4.0.0

Rewrite by https://github.com/aartiPl

Functionality:

* Recursive inclusion of dependant scripts without hardcoded limits

Improved test_suite.sh

* Automatic setting up of test environment (assert.sh, test directories)
* Automatic compilation
* idea - script to help to test idea use cases
* Script setup_environment.sh can be used for local testing
* Some script tests moved to Unit Tests
* Ability to start test suites by name

Improved Unit Tests

* Several new Unit tests
* New Unit Tests can be created much easier (Major point why modularization makes sense)

Improved Logging

* Silent mode / Development mode logging

Modularisation of source code

* Removed duplication
* Code divided in logical pieces and moved to packages
* Script resolution creates immutable objects

Build script

* Updated Gradle to version 7.4.3 and shadowJar to 7.1.2
* Fixes in build file

Performance

* Much less IO operations - that should contribute to better performance

Misc

* Updated Kotlin to 1.5.31, but only for compiler, not kotlin-scripting. It's far from optimal, but it is not possible
  to move fully to Kotlin 1.5 or even 1.6, because of the issues with resolution of artifacts in latest
  kotlin-scripting. I have put report here: https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-49511
* Fixed a lot of IDE warnings in code
* Packaging - gradle file converted to Kotlin; still does not work, but it was like that before anyway
* Changes for kscript dir allow simple implementation of config file if needed. (.kscript/kscript.config); Not
  implemented by me, but might be useful e.g. for storing preambles

INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES:

* In annotations the only allowed delimiter is coma "," (to allow options with arguments, separated by space)
* Resolution of env variables is more restrictive - only vars expected by kscript can be resolved (for security - it's
  not good to include arbitrary strings from user env into the script)
* Reworked caching mechanism

## 3.2

  fixes [#18](https://github.com/holgerbrandl/kscript/issues/18))
* More robust dependency resolution with more informative error messages

Support API improvements

* Kotlin DocOpt helpers to build
  CLIs ([example](https://github.com/holgerbrandl/kscript-support-api/blob/master/src/test/kotlin/kscript/test/DocOptTest.kt))
* New [utilities](https://github.com/holgerbrandl/kscript-support-api/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/kscript/StreamUtil.kt)
  to automatically resolve arguments files and stdin to `Sequence<String` for by-line processing

Other changes

* Allow dependencies to be declared in multiple lines prefixed by `//DEPS` (
  fixes [#2](https://github.com/holgerbrandl/kscript/issues/2))
* To ensure long-term stability of `kscript` we've added a suite of [unit tests](test/TestsReadme.md). The repository
  tested continuously by [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/holgerbrandl/kscript)
* Cache directory is now `~/.kscript`
* More heuristics to guess `KOTLIN_HOME`
* Cache cleanup `--clear-cache` now applies to jars, scripts, urls, and cached dependency lookups

  (fixes [#15](https://github.com/holgerbrandl/kscript/issues/15))
* Added `-i` to dump interactive console command incl deps (
  fixes [#10](https://github.com/holgerbrandl/kscript/issues/10))
