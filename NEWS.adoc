== [4.0.x] - (last 4.0.3 - 2022-05-28)

**Rewrite by https://github.com/aartiPl**

Functionality:

* Recursive inclusion of dependant scripts without hardcoded limits

Improved test_suite.sh

* Automatic setting up of test environment (assert.sh, test directories)
* Automatic compilation
* idea - script to help to test idea use cases
* Script setup_environment.sh can be used for local testing
* Some script tests moved to Unit Tests
* Ability to start test suites by name

Improved Unit Tests

* Several new Unit tests
* New Unit Tests can be created much easier (Major point why modularization makes sense)

Improved Logging

* Silent mode / Development mode logging

Modularisation of source code

* Removed duplication
* Code divided in logical pieces and moved to packages
* Script resolution creates immutable objects

Build script

* Updated Gradle to version 7.4.3 and shadowJar to 7.1.2
* Fixes in build file

Performance

* Much less IO operations - that should contribute to better performance

Misc

* Updated Kotlin to 1.5.31, but only for compiler, not kotlin-scripting. It's far from optimal, but it is not possible
 to move fully to Kotlin 1.5 or even 1.6, because of the issues with resolution of artifacts in latest
 kotlin-scripting. I have put report here: https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-49511
* Fixed a lot of IDE warnings in code
* Packaging - gradle file converted to Kotlin; still does not work, but it was like that before anyway
* Changes for kscript dir allow simple implementation of config file if needed. (.kscript/kscript.config); Not
 implemented by me, but might be useful e.g. for storing preambles

INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES:

* In annotations the only allowed delimiter is coma "," (to allow options with arguments, separated by space)
* Resolution of env variables is more restrictive - only vars expected by kscript can be resolved (for security - it's
 not good to include arbitrary strings from user env into the script)
* Reworked caching mechanism

== [3.2]

Other changes

* Allow dependencies to be declared in multiple lines prefixed by `//DEPS` (
 fixes https://github.com/holgerbrandl/kscript/issues/2[#2])
